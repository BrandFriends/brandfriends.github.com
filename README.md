##Working with Github

You can download a [ZIP file](https://github.com/BrandFriends/brandfriends.github.com/zipball/master) here, but it is better to do it like this...

* On a Mac install the [Github Mac Client](http://mac.github.com/)
* On windows install the [Github Windows Client](http://windows.github.com/)

With a Github client you can get the source code on your local machine.
After you **add new files** or **made changes** you can push it back to Github with this client.

Steps to get a Github project on your computer...

1. **Clone** the repository (use the button on the Github page)

Steps to commit back to Github...

1. **Add** the changes and/or new files
2. **Commit** the changes and *add a description*.
3. **Push** the changes to Github

If you have an older version on your computer and you want to update your project

1. **Pull** from Github to update your local version
